A 3D game in which the player is inside a maze and have to find the exit before to be crush by the minotaur !

This game have been made by the "Deity Crew", a team of 4 students:
- Thibault "TTD" Chevrin
- Kevin "Kev2a" De Castro
- Wahren "Waouf" Chiguer
- Jonathan "Martial" Jarri

We used C# langage with XNA. You need XNA 3.1 and Visual Studio 2008 to compile it !
